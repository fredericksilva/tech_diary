summary: 
ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, 
processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, 
tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.
