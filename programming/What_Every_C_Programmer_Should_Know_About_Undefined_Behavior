title: What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior
link: http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html
tag: undefined behavior, C
status: done
summary:
1. compile options for detecting undefined behavior: the -ftrapv and -fcatch-undefined-behavior flags, 
(-fno-strict-aliasing flag disables Type Based Alias Analysis)
2. Stores to null and calls through null pointers are turned into a __builtin_trap() 
call (which turns into a trapping instruction like "ud2" on x86)
3. the Clang Static Analyzer, Klee project, and the -fcatch-undefined-behavior flag are useful tools.

4. build with "-Wall -Wextra".
