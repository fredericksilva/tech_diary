summary:
The Artificial Intelligence Repository was established by Mark
Kantrowitz in 1993 to collect files, programs and publications of
interest to Artificial Intelligence researchers, educators, and
students. It is an outgrowth of the Lisp Utilities Repository
established by Mark in 1990 and his work on the FAQ (Frequently Asked
Questions) postings for the AI, Lisp, Scheme, and Prolog newsgroups.
The Lisp Utilities Repository has been merged into the AI Repository.
