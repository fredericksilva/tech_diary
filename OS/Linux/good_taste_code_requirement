summary:
"good taste" coding requirement is the elimination of edge cases, The fewer conditions you test for, the better your code “tastes”, 
is that they take the time to conceptualize what they are building before they start. They define the boundaries of the components 
they are working with, and how they interact with each other. They try to ensure everything fits well together, and that execution 
flows elegantly.
