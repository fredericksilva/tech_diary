summary:
GrsecurityÂ® is an extensive security enhancement to the Linux kernel that 
defends against a wide range of security threats through intelligent access 
control, memory corruption-based exploit prevention, and a host of other 
system hardening that generally require no configuration. It has been actively 
developed and maintained for the past 15 years. Commercial support for grsecurity 
is available through Open Source Security, Inc.
