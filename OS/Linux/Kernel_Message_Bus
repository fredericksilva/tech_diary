summary:
The bus1 Kernel Message Bus defines and implements a distributed object model. 
It allows local processes to send messages to objects owned by remote processes, 
as well as share their own objects with others. Object ownership is static and 
cannot be transferred. Access to remote objects is prohibited, unless it was 
explicitly granted. Processes can transmit messages to a remote object via the 
message bus, transferring a data payload, object access rights, file descriptors, 
or other auxiliary data.
